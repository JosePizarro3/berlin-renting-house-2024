# PyRent

I am trying to create a database with offers seen in ImmoScout24. As the website is pretty obscure (without API), I am determined to simply print the pdfs of offers and categorize them in terms of price per square meter.

Once I accumulate some data, I will create a database and parse the pdf information into a structured json to do some Data Analysis.
